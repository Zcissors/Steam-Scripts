# Level-Watch.py

**Assuming you have python installed already**
* Clone into folder.

* Open command-prompt in that folder.

* Type '*py -m pip install requests*' hit enter and let requests install.

* Navigate your way to https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and gather yourself 
an API key after a long time fighting for one like the warrior you are.

* Create a *token.json* file in the same folder as *Level-Watch.py*,
paste in this huge chunk of words.

`{"s-key": "yourtokenhere"}`
 
* Don't forget to save that bad boy.

* Now back to the command-prompt, type '*py -m Level-Watch.py*' and it should look
almost pretty.
